Here main observation is:
  
Total number of 1 digit numbers is = (9-1)+1=9 and they occupy 9 digits 
Total number of 2 digit numbers is = (99-10)=90 and they occupy (90*2) digits 
Total number of 2 digit numbers is = (999-100)=900 and they occupy (900*3) digits 
Total number of 2 digit numbers is = (9999-1000)=9000 and they occupy (9000*4) digits 
and so on.


Now , the highest value of k is 10^18
It means we have to find the 10^18th digit in the string


If we sum up the total digits for 1 digit numbers, 2 digit numbers and further, highest we will need
up to 17 digit number..as the total 17 digit numbers is 17* 10^16.. which will not exceed long long.
Its simple mathematical calculation

1. So we can precalculate an array, where we will store for every i from 1 to 17, how many i digits number are there
   as we can see from the above 4 calculations

2. Then for each k in query, we can find the upper_bound of k from the array.. It means we can find in which digit index
   index our kth position lies

3. We can simply substract array values from k from the beginning and stop when the remaining k value is 
   less than the next array value.
4. The stopping index will indicate the digits of each numbers of the indexed range of the array

5. Then we will find the first number that starts with the index times digits

6. Then we will just find the number in which the kth position lies by just dividing the remaining value
   of k by current index as current index denotes the digits

7. Then we will take the rounded down value of the division.

8. Also we will calculate the remainder if k is not completely divided by index

9. Then add this division value with the value calculated in step 5.
10. Now we have the number at which the k position may( or may not ) lie

10. If the remainder is 0, the the last digit of this number is answer

11. If there is remainder.. then the answer lies in the next number. So add 1 to this number

12. Now get the remainder(th) digit from the number..( counting start from the left )
  
   ( suppose the remainder is 4..so start counting from the leftmost digit of the number and
     pick the 4th digit of the number. This is the answer )
